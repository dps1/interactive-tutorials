#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char multidimensional_array[] = "One\0Two\0Three";
    char *pointer = multidimensional_array;
    printf("%c \n",*(pointer + 8 +2));
    
}


ABOVE IS AN EXAMPLE OF CODE ON MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAY THAT HELPS YOU PRINT A SPECIFIC CHARACTER FROM THE 
ARRAY WHEN YOU KNOW ITS POSITION.
